In this shinyapp we use the data diamonds available in ggplot2 (see http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/diamonds.html)
The objective of the aplication is to make a price prediction of the diamond based on
these predictors:

* carat. weight of the diamond (0.2--5.01)
* cut. quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)
* colour. diamond colour, from J (worst) to D (best)
* clarity. a measurement of how clear the diamond is (I1 (worst), SI1, SI2, VS1, VS2, VVS1, VVS2, IF (best))

For this purpose, the user can chose among diferent models and define the tuning parameters:

* Tree model
* Random Forest
* GBM

Finally, based on the last model selected, the user can make single predictions of a diamond price.

### Data treatment

The data is split in training set (60%) and testing set (40%). This split changes every time that a session is started.
The exploratory analysis and the model fit is made with the training set.
